/// <b>SeaweedFS accepts the configuration and then breaks the bucket.</b>
/// Measured 2026-09-07, identically on 4.43 and 4.45:
/// <c>PutBucketEncryption</c> is accepted, <c>GetBucketEncryption</c> returns
/// the rule, and every write to that bucket afterwards fails with "we
/// encountered an internal error". A write to the same bucket before the call
/// succeeds. So the store does not refuse what it cannot do — it agrees and
/// then stops working, which is worse and is why this skips rather than fails
/// there.

/// RustFS 1.0.0-rc.5 accepts it, keeps serving, and reports <c>AES256</c> for

/// runs it.
